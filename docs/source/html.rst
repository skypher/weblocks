 HTML generation
=================

At the moment only CL-WHO is supported out of the box, but YACLML and others may
also be used.

See ``with-html``, ``with-html-to-string`` for pure html rendering with
cl-who.

See ``with-javascript``, ``with-javascript-to-string``, ``send-script``
for rendering javascript code inside of script tags.

For javascript there are some other helpers ``noscript`` and ``scriptonly``.
