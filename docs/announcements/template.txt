Weblocks <VERSION> released
===========================

Weblocks is an advanced web framework written in Common Lisp.

It is designed to make Agile web application development as
effective and simple as possible.

Weblocks uses powerful Lisp features like multiple dispatch, the
metaobject protocol, lexical closures, keyword arguments, and macros
to build abstractions that make web development easy, intuitive, and
free of boilerplate. In addition, control flow is easily expressed
using continuations.

Things that are hard or mundane in other frameworks become easy and
fun in Weblocks.


AUDIENCE

People who want to get their real-life web programming done
as effectively as possible.

Weblocks is not only targeted at old hands but also at
newcomers to Lisp and Lisp web programming.

It offers a helpful community and code that prevents you
from shooting yourself too easily in the foot.
