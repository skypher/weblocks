  mapping URI tokens to widgets: static maps, dynamically-generated
  widgets, dynamically-generated widgets with caching. Returns a widget
  or NIL if not found. Modifies URI-TOKENS.

  The whole tree update protocol goes like this:

  1) HANDLE-NORMAL-REQUEST calls UPDATE-WIDGET-TREE, which walks the
  tree using WALK-WIDGET-TREE starting at ROOT-WIDGET and calling
  update-children at every node.

  2) The selector's UPDATE-CHILDREN method (valid for all selectors,
  i.e. widgets that process URI tokens) calls GET-WIDGET-FOR-TOKENS.

  3) if a widget corresponding to particular URI tokens is found,
  UPDATE-CHILDREN calls UPDATE-DEPENDENTS, so that the selector (or its
  subclass) may update its dependents list and do other housekeeping.
  The default implementation of UPDATE-DEPENDENTS just calls
  (SETF WIDGET-CHILDREN) to store the children under the :SELECTOR
  type.

  Usually the only thing you'll want to do if you are implementing your
  own kind of selector is to subclass selector and provide a
  GET-WIDGET-FOR-TOKENS method for it. See class ON-DEMAND-SELECTOR for
  an example."))

  ;;
  ;; Note that here we are carefully managing the uri-tokens instance.
  ;; The uri-tokens keep track of what we have traversed upto now and
  ;; this method will remove (modify) tokens that are used when making the selection.
  ;;
  ;; The behaviour is slightly tricky because we handle a few cases.
  ;; 
  ;; 1 - the token to be consumed (token) is indeed selecting a widget.
  ;;     This is the normal case, and we pop the token from the uri-tokens
  ;;     and return the selected pane.
  ;;     
  ;; 2 - There are no tokens left anymore.
  ;;     In that case we select and return the default pane.
  ;;     now the default pane comes into 2 flavours:
  ;;       2a. explicitly associated with the nil token
  ;;       2b. The first pane available if there is pane associated with the
  ;;           default token.
  ;;     In both case we return the default pane, but in case 2a.
  ;;     we add the token to the consumed list.
  ;;     The reason that this is needed is for nested selectors.
  ;;     Because the child selectors need to have the selector token
  ;;     in their base path, otherwise selecting a sub navigationwidget
  ;;     will create the wrong path (it is missing the selection token
  ;;     for this SELECTOR.
  ;;     
  ;;
  ;; 3 - There are tokens left, but the token does not select a pane AND
  ;;     there is a default pane associated with NIL.
  ;;
  ;;     In that case it should return the child pane.
  ;;
  ;;
  ;; Upshot of this all is that this code will, if possible,
  ;;
  ;;  1 - Return the selected pane.
  ;;  2 - Remove the token used to select this pane, if a token was used.
  ;;  3 - Make sure that if the selected pane has a token associated to it, it
  ;;      is added to the consumed token list.
