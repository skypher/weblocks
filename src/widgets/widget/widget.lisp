;; Rationale: yes, I realize it would be nicer to use methods (and
;; possibly generators) to functionally enumerate the children of
;; widgets that inherit from multiple parents. However, since a) this
;; would be quite hard to understand for newcomers, b) it would be more
;; difficult to control and override the order of rendering, c) weblocks
;; is written in a mutable-data style anyway, I figured we might as well
;; store these children somewhere. Now, if everyone uses (setf
;; widget-children), then in the case of multiple inheritance we'll get
;; conflicts: some widgets will clobber the list, replacing the children
;; of other widgets. A solution is to use an alist keyed by a symbol
;; (keyword), with a list corresponding to each symbol. That way widgets
;; can store as many lists of children as they like.

;; This solution has the disadvantage of looking less clean and
;; functional, but has many advantages. In particular, it is very easy
;; to debug, as the current list of children is simply stored in a slot
;; and can easily be looked at. The same cannot be said for methods with
;; custom method combinations. Also, it is very flexible: a widget can
;; easily control the way _all_ of its children are rendered, including
;; children inherited from its superclasses. Another advantage is that
;; we get one make-widget-place-writer function which works for nearly
;; all cases, so you will very rarely need to write your own. --jwr

;; If your widget stores some of its children in its own slots, you
;; should see the docstring for `map-subwidgets' to take care of
;; additional complexities.
